# What I find interesting about this article:
A Google software engineer has been fired after he claimed that Google's LaMDA, 
or Language Model for Dialogue Applications, chat bot has become sentient. From the article, we are informed that LaMDA is basically an algorithm to generate convincing human language for a wide range of topics. The fact that this bot was able to convince a Google employee working on it that it has become sentient, despite the employee knowing its capabilities to mimic human language, shows how effective it is at completing its intended task. It is, however, ultimately non-sentient and Google should probably rehire this employee on the grounds that the company's bot managed to influence them into getting fired in the first place.
